# Schoodle

This app is single-page event scheduler, based off of [Doodle](https://doodle.com/).
* The event creator can provide information about it, set up to 4 time-slots, and share the created event via a unique-ID link - or delete it, if unhappy with it.
* The guests are allowed to select multiple choices, and to edit or delete their entry. Once their vote is submitted, a graph and a table are presented, to display the other guests participating and their availability.

Schoodle is the collaborative mid-term project for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp. Its front-end is built through HTML, SASS and jQuery. Requests to the back-end are entirely made via AJAX. The server is built through NodeJS, and uses Express as framework. The database is managed via PostgreSQL.
